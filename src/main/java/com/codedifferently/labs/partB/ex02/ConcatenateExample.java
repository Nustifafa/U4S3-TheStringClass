package com.codedifferently.labs.partB.ex02; //specifies the package in which the current Java class belongs. Packages are used to group related classes and interfaces together, helping organize the code and avoid naming conflicts.

public class ConcatenateExample { //defines class in Java. "Public" is the access modifier, it means the class is accessible from any other class or package. It indicates that the class is publicly visible and can be used by other parts of the program.
    //class: This keyword is used to define a class in Java. A class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances) and can contain fields (variables) and methods (functions).
    //ConcatenateExample: This is the name of the class. By convention, class names in Java start with an uppercase letter and are written in CamelCase (each word starts with an uppercase letter). This class likely deals with some kind of concatenation (joining strings, for example).
    public static String concat(){ //is a declaration of a method in Java. "Static" means that the method belongs to the class itself, not to instances (objects) of the class. You can call this method directly on the class without needing to create an instance of it.
        //String: This is the return type of the method. It indicates that the method will return a value of type String. So, after the method finishes executing, it will return a String.
        //concat(): This is the method name. It's a convention to name the method based on what it does, and here it suggests that the method is related to concatenating (joining) strings. The parentheses () are where parameters would go if the method required any.
        String response = ""; //String: This is the data type of the variable. It indicates that the variable response will hold a string (a sequence of characters).
        //response: This is the variable name. It's the identifier used to refer to the value stored in this variable. You can choose any name for the variable, but response suggests that it might be used to store some kind of answer or result.
        //= "": This is the initialization of the variable. It sets response to an empty string (""). An empty string is a string with zero characters.
        String myString = "Hello"; //String: This is the data type of the variable. It indicates that the variable myString will hold a string (a sequence of characters).
        //myString: This is the variable name. It's the identifier that you use to refer to this specific string value in your code. In this case, it seems to represent a string (perhaps for storing a greeting or some other message).
        //= "Hello": This is the initialization of the variable. It assigns the string value "Hello" to the myString variable.
        myString = myString + "!"; //myString: This refers to the variable myString, which initially holds the value "Hello".
        //+: The + operator is used for string concatenation in Java. It combines two strings together.
        //"!": This is the string that is being concatenated to the value of myString. It's a string containing the exclamation mark character.
        //myString = myString + "!";: This statement updates the value of myString by appending the "!" character to its current value. Initially, myString was "Hello", so after this line, myString will hold the value "Hello!".
        response += myString; //response: This is the variable that holds the current string value. In your previous example, it might have started as an empty string (""), but now it's being updated
        //+=: This is the concatenation operator in Java. It's shorthand for combining the current value of response with the value of myString and then storing the result back into response.
        //myString: This refers to the variable that holds a string value, such as "Hello!" (from your previous example).
        //So, if response was initially "" (an empty string) and myString is "Hello!", then after executing response += myString;, the value of response will become "Hello!".
        //The += operator simplifies the process, so instead of writing: response = response + myString;
        //You can just use the += operator to achieve the same result in a more concise way.



        return response; //return: This keyword indicates that the method will end and send a value back to the code that called the method.
        // response: This is the value being returned. In this case, response is likely a string variable that holds some value, and that value will be returned to the method's caller.

        //String[] args: This is a parameter to the main method. It represents an array of command-line arguments passed to the program when it is run. These arguments are typically used to provide input values to the program. args stands for "arguments", and each item in the array is a string (even if it's a number or another type of input).
